# Password-Generator

A simple Java program with a login portal (just to test and understand GUI capabilities) which will generate a secure random password for you if you can log in successfully.

For testing purposes, you can use the following credentials 
User: admin
Password: admin

Then click "Generate Password" to generate a unique password that can only be seen once. Close the window to exit the program.
